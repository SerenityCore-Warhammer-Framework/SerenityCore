# SerenityCore
SerenityCore is a Warhammer Online MMORPG Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from [MaNGOS](https://github.com/mangos/MaNGOS), the Massive Network Game Object Server, and [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) and is based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
